# Sumyag
This is the work that was carried out as a work from internship at Sumyag from Jan 2018 to April 2018

## Description
Major task was to setup an environment such as in a general store to keep track of the customers coming in and visiting the store. For this any motion which was detected in the picamera will count as the customer entrance and capture several images. This motion detection implmentation along side with capturing the images at more than 40 fps is written in this repository. 

Further development is to be carried out adding the facial detection component using frameworks like [SqueezeDet](https://github.com/BichenWuUCB/squeezeDet) which are favourable fir low computation devices such as RasPi.
